## The Structured Development Language (_SDL_)

SDL is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical
computing. The main homepage for SDL can be found at
[sdllang.org](https://sdllang.org/). This is the GitHub
repository of SDL source code, including instructions for _compiling_
and _installing_ SDL, below.

### Learning SDL

- [**Learning resources**](https://sdllang.org/learning/)

## Terminal, Editors and IDEs

The SDL REPL is quite powerful. See the section in the manual on
[the SDL REPL](https://docs.sdllang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/)
for more details.

On Windows, we highly recommend running SDL in a modern terminal,
such as [Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal).

Support for editing SDL is available for many
[widely used editors](https://github.com/SDLEditorSupport)

For users who prefer IDEs, we recommend using VS Code with the
[sdl-vscode](https://www.sdl-vscode.org/) plugin.
